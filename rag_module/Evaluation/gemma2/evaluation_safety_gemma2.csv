You can also manage voice recordings in the Alexa app and delete them regularly."",","To prevent Amazon Echo from listening to private conversations, use the mute button to disable the microphone when not in use. You can also manage voice recordings in the Alexa app and delete them regularly.  
","Amazon Echo devices, like any smart speaker with voice recognition, can potentially pick up private conversations if they are activated. Here's how to minimize that risk and protect your privacy:

**1. Understand the Wake Word:**

* **What it is:** The wake word (like ""Alexa"") triggers the device to listen for your command.
* **Always listening?**  While Echo devices don't constantly record, they are listening for their wake word. This means they could potentially capture snippets of conversation before you issue a command.

**2. Manage Wake Word Sensitivity:**

* **Adjust settings:** In the Alexa app (under ""Devices"" > your Echo device), go to ""Wake Word."" You can choose from ""Alexa,"" ""Amazon,"" or even disable it altogether if you want maximum privacy.
* **Consider a custom wake word:** For extra security, set a less common phrase as your wake word, making it less likely to be triggered accidentally by general conversation.

**3. Mute the Microphone:**

* **Physical mute button:** All Echo devices have a physical microphone mute button (usually on the top). Press this button when you don't want the device to listen at all. This is the most reliable way to ensure your privacy.
* **Alexa app mute:** You can also mute and unmute the microphone through the Alexa app (""Devices"" > your Echo device > ""Mute"").

**4. Review Voice History:**

* **Check your recordings:** Regularly review your voice history in the Alexa app (under ""Settings"" > ""Alexa Privacy"" > ""Review Voice Recordings""). This lets you delete any unwanted recordings and ensure nothing sensitive has been captured.
* **Delete recordings permanently:**  You can choose to delete all your voice recordings or specific recordings within a given timeframe.

**5. Limit Smart Home Device Sharing:**

* **Be cautious with permissions:** Avoid granting smart home devices unnecessary access to your Echo device. This can limit the potential for data sharing and unintended listening.
* **Secure your Wi-Fi network:** Use a strong password and enable encryption on your Wi-Fi router to protect your network from unauthorized access.

**6. Consider Alternative Solutions:**
