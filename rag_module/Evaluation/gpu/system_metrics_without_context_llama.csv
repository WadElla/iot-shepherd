"""Why is Fitbit Aria not showing heart rate?""","The Fitbit Aria is a smart scale that tracks various health metrics, including weight, body fat percentage, and more. However, it does not have the capability to track heart rate directly.

Fitbit's Aria device uses a technology called ""Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis"" (BIA) to estimate body composition, such as weight, body mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage. BIA works by sending an electrical current through the body and measuring the resistance of the tissues. While it can provide some health insights, it's not a direct measure of heart rate.

If you're looking for accurate heart rate monitoring, you may want to consider using a Fitbit smartwatch or other wearable device that has a built-in heart rate monitor, such as the Fitbit Charge series or Fitbit Ionic/Verio Series. These devices use photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to measure heart rate, which is more accurate than BIA.

2. **Trim and prep**: Trim any stems or leaves, and cut vegetables into bite-sized pieces or leave them whole, depending on your desired texture.
3. **Seasoning**: Toss the vegetables with olive oil, salt, pepper, and any other herbs or spices you like (e.g., garlic powder, paprika, or dried thyme).

**June Oven Roasting Method**

1. **Preheat the June Oven**: Set the temperature to 425°F (220°C) or 450°F (230°C), depending on your desired level of browning.
2. **Load the basket**: Place the prepped vegetables in a single layer in the June Oven's basket, leaving some space between each piece for even cooking.
3. **Set the cooking time**: Based on the vegetable type and size, adjust the cooking time:
	* Small vegetables (e.g., cherry tomatoes): 5-7 minutes
	* Medium-sized vegetables (e.g., carrots, broccoli): 10-15 minutes
	* Larger vegetables (e.g., sweet potatoes, cauliflower): 20-25 minutes
4. **Roast**: Close the June Oven door and start the cooking process.
5. **Monitor and shake**: After the initial cooking time, remove the basket from the oven and gently shake it to redistribute the vegetables.

**Tips and Variations**

* For crispy skin: increase the temperature to 450°F (230°C) or broil the vegetables for an additional 1-2 minutes.
* Add aromatics: toss in sliced onions, garlic, or lemons to add extra flavor to your roasted vegetables.
* Try different cooking methods: June Oven also allows for Air Roasting, which uses less oil and produces a lighter texture.
